	<h2 class="h2">Q: How are the fruits and vegetables packaged?</h2>
	<h3 class="h3">A: Fresh fruits and vegetables are hand picked and hand cleaned. We ensure hygienic and careful handling of all our products.</h3>
	<h2 class="h2">Q: How are the fruits and vegetables weighed?</h2>
	<h3 class="h3">A: Every fruit and vegetable varies a little in size and weight. While you shop we show an estimated weight and price for everything priced by kilogram. At the time of delivery we weigh each item to determine final price. This could vary by a maximum of one unit weight depending on the article. In case the weight of the product is lesser than what you ordered, you will pay correspondingly less.</h3>

	<h2 class="h2">Q: Where do you source your products from?</h2>
